Remaining Work
--------------
1. Refactor `step::correct()` so that it does not always choose the decided value for the next phase
1. Binary (de)serialization
1. Adverserial strategy for sending random bytes
1. Implement TCP transport
1. Read the args from a config file
1. Use the `log` crate for logging with serverity instead of writing everything to `stderr`
1. Use `tokio` for lightweight async tasks instead of threads
1. ncurses based frontend to show the process states
1. Return `Result` fallible functions instead of logging and ignoring errors
