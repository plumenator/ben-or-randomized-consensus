Remaining Work
--------------
1. Refactor `step::correct()` so that it does not always choose the decided value for the next phase
1. Adverserial strategy for sending random bytes
1. Implement TCP transport
1. Read the args from a config file
1. Use the `log` crate for logging with serverity instead of writing everything to `stderr`
1. Use `tokio` for lightweight async tasks instead of threads
1. ncurses based frontend to show the process states
1. Return `Result` fallible functions instead of logging and ignoring errors
